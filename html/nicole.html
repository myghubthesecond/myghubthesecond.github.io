                    Dear prao,
                </br>
                    Happy twenty first!!!! woo!!!! 
                    u gotta let me know what alcohol tastes like once u have ur first sip today 
                    (i am dying on the edge of my seat here)!  
                </br></br>
                    not to #soundlikeamom but when did we grow up so fast? 
                    ur now giving adult for real  (18s the test run).  wack.
                    I do genuinely believe that I would have crossed paths 
                    with you at some point as Penn bc #hsocpremedsunite but I am literally 
                    the luckiest person because to me, you didnâ€™t end up being that random
                     HSOC friend you have class with and literally never think about ever. 
                      Freshman year, before I really even knew you,
                       I remember we FaceTimed to do a Berry chem quiz, and you were making mac
                        and cheese in a Harnwell mug gifted to us during move in, 
                        and I just had a feeling of absolute happiness because 
                        I knew with such certainty that we were gonna end up being close. 
                         And I was right! (not to toot my own horn but) 
                        </br></br>
                    You are genuinely one of the best things that has ever happened to me 
                    - I didnâ€™t know that I could feel so supported, 
                    so connected to, and just so fucking loved by a friend 
                    the way that you make me feel.  When Iâ€™m sad, when Iâ€™m happy, 
                    when Iâ€™m embarrassed by my own irrationality, I know itsâ€™ always 
                    okay because I have you- that feeling is priceless- you make me feel
                     that no matter what, Iâ€™ll have someone who loves me unconditionally. 
                      I literally donâ€™t now how I did life before you were apart of it-
                       you have been such a vital part of my life for the past three years, 
                       and I wouldnâ€™t ever want it any other way ðŸ«¶
                    You light up every room you walk into- 
                    iâ€™ve never met someone whose able to be radiant in their interactions 
                    the way that you are- your presence anytime,
                     anyplace is just about the best thing ever. 
                      I wish so badly that you could see yourself the way I see you 
                      (you would be in absolute awe or ur own being) 
                      I really hope you know that there are so, so many people whose 
                      lives are astronomically better because they are lucky enough to
                       have you as part of their life. 
                        Iâ€™m happily in the front of that long line. 
                    </br></br>
                         Thereâ€™s not quite the right words to tell you how 
                         much you mean to me(even all 7 of the greek versions 
                         of love arenâ€™t nuanced enough for the way i love you smh) 
                         but this was part of my attempt to.  
                        </br></br>happy birthday, 
                         i absolutely adore you. 
                        </br>thanks for taking my hemos virginity :) 
                         (i wouldnâ€™t have wanted to lose it to anyone else)
